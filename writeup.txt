Then the hacker can modify the valid program and change the essential part of the code inside and keep all the remaining same. Then if the code is still in same MD5 hash with the original one, the users who download the fake program will still consider the one as genuine before installing and execution since the fake one can pass the MD5 hash authentication. And by this method, the hackers may be able to use the fake program to hack into users' machine.
